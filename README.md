# hello-world
This is my very first repository on GitHub. This is also my very first written description of anything on GitHub.

This is my first edit on GitHub.
My name is Steven. I have chosen to switch my career from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science. I am mathematics-oriented, and I like solving puzzles.
